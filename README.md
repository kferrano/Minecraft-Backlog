# Minecraft Master Backlog

This repository is the **central public backlog** for all of my Minecraft mods and modpacks.

It is used to:
- collect **bug reports** from players and admins
- collect **feature requests**
- track **todos, refactors, and technical debt**
- plan **releases, ports, and larger milestones**
- provide transparency for **modpack developers**

This repository does **not** contain mod source code.  
It is purely for tracking, planning, and coordination.

## 🐞 How to report a bug

If you are a player:

- Or create a **GitHub Issue** using the *Bug Report* template

GitHub is **optional**, not required.

If you are an admin or modpack developer:
- Please use GitHub Issues for reproducible bugs or technical problems.

## 💡 How to request a feature

Feature requests are welcome and can be submitted using the  
**Feature Request** issue template.

Please note:
- Not every feature request will be implemented
- Decisions are based on feasibility, scope, and maintenance effort

## 🗂 Project Structure

- **Issues**  
  Individual bugs, feature requests, and development tasks

- **Projects**  
  The *Minecraft – Master Backlog* project is used as the global overview across all mods

- **Milestones**  
  Used for releases, ports, and larger goals  
  (e.g. `MC 1.21.x Port`, `PlayerAnalytic v1.4.0`)

## 🧠 Philosophy

- Low barrier for reporting
- No unnecessary bureaucracy
- Clarity over perfection
- One central source of truth

If something is important, it will eventually end up here.

Thanks for helping improve the mods 👍
